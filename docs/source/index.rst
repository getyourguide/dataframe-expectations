DataFrame Expectations
======================

**DataFrameExpectations** is a Python library designed to validate **Pandas** and **PySpark** DataFrames using
customizable, reusable expectations. It simplifies testing in data pipelines and end-to-end workflows by providing a
standardized framework for DataFrame validation.

Instead of using different validation approaches for DataFrames, this library provides a standardized solution for this
use case. As a result, any contributions made here, such as adding new expectations, can be leveraged by all users of
the library.
